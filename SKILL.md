## Usage Examples

```
# List courses
canvas_list_courses

# Upcoming assignments for a course
canvas_list_assignments course_id:4538 bucket:upcoming order_by:due_at

# Assignments with grade status
canvas_list_assignments course_id:4538 bucket:past order_by:due_at include:["submission"]

# Get a specific page
canvas_get_page course_id:4538 page_slug:kurshandbok

# Submissions with grades and comments
canvas_list_submissions course_id:4538 include:["assignment","submission_comments"]

# Announcements across courses
canvas_list_announcements course_ids:[4538,3655]

# Planner items (requires both dates)
canvas_list_planner_items start_date:2026-02-20 end_date:2026-02-27

# Cross-reference with TimeEdit for implicit deadlines
canvas_timeedit_crossref course_id:4538 days_ahead:30
```

## TimeEdit Cross-Reference

Many Canvas assignments lack explicit due dates. The `canvas_timeedit_crossref` tool:

1. Fetches the TimeEdit ICS schedule
2. Fetches all Canvas assignments for the course
3. Keyword-matches assignment names to scheduled events
4. Assigns implicit deadlines based on the last matching event

**When asked about deadlines, schedule, or upcoming work, ALWAYS use this tool** to get the complete picture including undated assignments.

## Finding Files

`canvas_list_files` often returns 403 for student accounts. Instead:

1. Use `canvas_get_course_modules` + `canvas_get_module_items` to find file IDs in module items of type "File"
2. Check page HTML from `canvas_get_page` for file links
3. Use `canvas_get_file` with the found file ID

## Known Limitations

- `canvas_list_files` -> 403 for student permissions. Use `canvas_get_file` with known IDs.
- `canvas_list_quizzes` / `canvas_get_quiz` -> 404 if institution uses New Quizzes (quiz_lti).
- `canvas_list_planner_items` requires both `start_date` and `end_date` in ISO format.
- `canvas_timeedit_crossref` only available when `timeeditUrl` is configured.

## Agent Strategy

1. **Deadlines/schedule** -> `canvas_timeedit_crossref` first, then `canvas_list_planner_items`
2. **Course content** -> `canvas_get_page` with slug, or modules + module items
3. **Grades/submissions** -> `canvas_list_submissions` with include:["assignment","submission_comments"]
4. **News** -> `canvas_list_announcements` + `canvas_list_planner_items`
5. **Files** -> Find IDs via module items/pages, then `canvas_get_file`
